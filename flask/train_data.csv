"b'HOUSTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Years before a bystander\xe2\x80\x99s video of George Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s last moments turned his name into a global cry for justice, Floyd trained a camera on himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just want to speak to you all real quick,\xe2\x80\x9d Floyd says in one video, addressing the young men in his neighborhood who looked up to him. His 6-foot-7 frame crowds the picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my shortcomings and my flaws and I ain\xe2\x80\x99t better than nobody else,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, man, the shootings that\xe2\x80\x99s going on, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what \xe2\x80\x98hood you\xe2\x80\x99re from, where you\xe2\x80\x99re at, man. I love you and God loves you. Put them guns down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\nEDITOR\xe2\x80\x99S NOTE: The Associated Press initially published this profile of George Floyd on June 10, 2020. Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted by a jury on April 20, 2021, of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.\r\n\r\n___\r\nAt the time, Floyd was respected as a man who spoke from hard, but hardly extraordinary, experience. He had nothing remotely like the stature he has gained in death, embraced as a universal symbol of the need to overhaul policing and held up as a heroic everyman.\r\n\r\nBut the reality of his 46 years on Earth, including sharp edges and setbacks Floyd himself acknowledged, was both much fuller and more complicated.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a star athlete with dreams of turning pro and enough talent to win a partial scholarship, Floyd returned home only to bounce between jobs before serving nearly five years in prison. Intensely proud of his roots in Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Third Ward and admired as a mentor in a public housing project beset by poverty, he decided the only way forward was to leave it behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had made some mistakes that cost him some years of his life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ronnie Lillard, a friend and rapper who performs under the name Reconcile. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when he got out of that, I think the Lord greatly impacted his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n___\r\nFloyd was born in North Carolina. But his mother, a single parent, moved the family to Houston when he was 2, so she could search for work. They settled in the Cuney Homes, a low-slung warren of more than 500 apartments south of downtown nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood, for decades a cornerstone of Houston\xe2\x80\x99s black community, has gentrified in recent years. Texas Southern University, a historically black campus directly across the street from the projects, has long held itself out as a launchpad for those willing to strive. But many residents struggle, with incomes about half the city average and unemployment nearly four times higher, even before the recent economic collapse.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nYeura Hall, who grew up next door to Floyd, said even in the Third Ward other kids looked down on those who lived in public housing. To deflect the teasing, he, Floyd and other boys made up a song about themselves: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to grow up, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Cuney Homes kid. They got so many rats and roaches I can play with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLarcenia Floyd invested her hopes in her son, who as a second-grader wrote that he dreamed of being a U.S. Supreme Court justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thought that he would be the one that would bring them out of poverty and struggle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Travis Cains, a longtime friend.\r\n\r\nFloyd was a star tight end for the football team at Jack Yates High School, playing for the losing side in the 1992 state championship game at Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin.\r\n\r\nHe was an atypical football player. \xe2\x80\x9cWe used to call him \xe2\x80\x98Big Friendly,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Cervaanz Williams, a former teammate.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you said something to him, his head would drop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maurice McGowan, his football coach. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to ball up and act like he wanted to fight you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the basketball court, Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s height and strength won attention from George Walker, a former assistant coach at the University of Houston hired for the head job at what is now South Florida State College. The school was a 17-hour drive away, in a small town, but high school administrators and Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s mother urged him to go, Walker said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted George to really get out of the neighborhood, to do something, be something,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker said.\r\n\r\nIn Avon Park, Florida, Floyd and a few other players from Houston stood out for their size, accents and city cool. They lived in the Jacaranda Hotel, a historic lodge used as a dormitory, and were known as the \xe2\x80\x9cJac Boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was always telling me about the Third Ward of Houston, how rough it was, but how much he loved it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert Caldwell, a friend and fellow student who frequently traveled with the basketball team. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said people know how to grind, as hard as it is, people know how to love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter two years in Avon Park, Floyd spent a year at Texas A&M University in Kingsville before returning to Houston and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s apartment to find jobs in construction and security.\r\n\r\nLarcenia Floyd, known throughout the neighborhood as Ms. Cissy, welcomed her son\xe2\x80\x99s friends from childhood, offering their apartment as refuge when their lives grew stressful. When a neighbor went to prison on drug charges, Ms. Cissy took in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s pre-teen son, Cal Wayne, deputizing George to play older brother for the next 2\xc2\xbd years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would steal his jerseys and put his jerseys on and run around the house, go outside, jerseys all the way down to our ankles because he was so big and we were little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wayne, now a well-known rapper who credits Floyd with encouraging him to pursue music.\r\n\r\nGeorge Floyd, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas like a superhero.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n___\r\nFloyd, too, dabbled in music, occasionally invited to rap with Robert Earl Davis Jr. -- better known as DJ Screw, whose mixtapes have since been recognized as influential in charting Houston\xe2\x80\x99s place as a hotbed of hip-hop.\r\n\r\nBut then, the man known throughout Cuney as \xe2\x80\x9cBig Floyd,\xe2\x80\x9d started finding trouble.\r\n\r\nBetween 1997 and 2005, Floyd was arrested several times on drug and theft charges, spending months in jail. Around that time, Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Sheila Masters, recalled running into Floyd in the street and learning he was homeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s so tall he\xe2\x80\x99d pat me on my head ... and say, \xe2\x80\x98Mama you know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be all right,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Masters said.\r\n\r\nIn August 2007, Floyd was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Investigators said he and five other men barged into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, and Floyd pushed a pistol into her abdomen before searching for items to steal. Floyd pleaded guilty in 2009 and was sentenced to five years in prison. By the time he was paroled, in January 2013, he was nearing 40.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came home with his head on right,\xe2\x80\x9d said friend Travis Cains.\r\n\r\nAt a Christian rap concert in the Third Ward, Floyd met Lillard and pastor Patrick \xe2\x80\x9cPT\xe2\x80\x9d Ngwolo, whose ministry was looking for ways to reach residents in Cuney Homes. Floyd, who seemed to know everyone in the project, volunteered to be their guide.\r\n\r\nSoon Floyd was setting up a washtub on the Cuney basketball courts for baptisms by Ngwolo\xe2\x80\x99s newly formed Resurrection Houston congregation. He joined three-on-three basketball tournaments and barbecues, organized by the ministry. He knocked on doors with Ngwolo, introducing residents as candidates for grocery deliveries or Bible study.\r\n\r\nAnother pastor, Christopher Johnson, recalled Floyd stopping by his office while Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s mother was visiting. Decades had passed since Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s mother had been a teacher at Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s high school. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. He wrapped her in a bear hug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he ever thought of himself as being big,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of big dudes here, but he was a gentleman and a diplomat and I\xe2\x80\x99m not putting any sauce on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the streets of Cuney, Floyd was increasingly embraced as an O.G. -- literally \xe2\x80\x9coriginal gangster,\xe2\x80\x9d but bestowed as a title of respect for a mentor who\xe2\x80\x99d learned from life experience.\r\n\r\nIn Tiffany Cofield\xe2\x80\x99s classroom at a neighborhood charter school, some of her male students -- many of whom had already had brushes with the law -- told her to talk to \xe2\x80\x9cBig Floyd\xe2\x80\x9d if she wanted to understand.\r\n\r\nFloyd would listen patiently as she voiced her frustrations with students\xe2\x80\x99 bad behavior, she said. And he would try to explain the life of a young man in the projects.\r\n\r\nAfter school, Floyd often met up with her students outside a corner store.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s school going?\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99d ask. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you being respectful? How\xe2\x80\x99s your mom? How\xe2\x80\x99s your grandma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn 2014, Floyd began exploring the possibility of leaving the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAs the father of five children from several relationships, he had bills to pay. And despite his stature in Cuney, everyday life could be trying. More than once, Floyd ended up in handcuffs when police came through the projects and detained a large number of men, Cofield said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would show by example: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, officer. No, officer.\xe2\x80\x99 Very respectful. Very calm tone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nA friend of Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s had already moved to the Twin Cities as part of a church discipleship program that offered men a route to self-sufficiency by changing their environment and helping them find jobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christopher Harris, who preceded Floyd to Minneapolis. Friends provided Floyd with money and clothing to ease the transition.\r\n\r\nIn Minneapolis, Floyd found a job as a security guard at the Salvation Army\xe2\x80\x99s Harbor Light Center -- the city\xe2\x80\x99s largest homeless shelter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would regularly walk a couple of female co-workers out ... at night and make sure they got to their cars safely and securely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian Molohon, director of development for the Army\xe2\x80\x99s Minnesota office. \xe2\x80\x9cJust a big strong guy, but with a very tender side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFloyd left after a little over a year, training to drive trucks while working as a bouncer at a club called Conga Latin Bistro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would dance badly to make people laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t because he was too tall for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFloyd kept his connection to Houston, regularly returning to Cuney.\r\n\r\nWhen Houston hosted the Super Bowl in 2017, Floyd was back in town, hosting a party at the church with music and free AIDS testing. He came back again for his mother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral the next year. And when Cains spoke with him last, a few weeks ago, Floyd was planning another trip for this summer.\r\n\r\nBy then, Floyd was out of work. Early this spring, Thunstrom cut Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s job when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the club to close.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Memorial Day, Floyd was with two others when convenience store employees accused him of paying for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill, then called the police. Less than an hour later, Floyd breathed his last.\r\n\r\nThose who knew him search for meaning in his death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the belief that he was chosen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cofield, the teacher. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly this could have happened to him because of who he was and the amount of love that he had for people, people had for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a small comfort, she admits. But, then, in Big Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood, people have long made do with less.\r\n'"
"b'On May 25, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after a convenience store employee called 911 and told the police that Mr. Floyd had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Seventeen minutes after the first squad car arrived at the scene, Mr. Floyd was unconscious and pinned beneath three police officers, showing no signs of life.\r\n\r\nBy combining videos from bystanders and security cameras, reviewing official documents and consulting experts, The New York Times reconstructed in detail the minutes leading to Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s death. Our video shows officers taking a series of actions that violated the policies of the Minneapolis Police Department and turned fatal, leaving Mr. Floyd unable to breathe, even as he and onlookers called out for help.\r\n\r\nThe day after Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s death, the Police Department fired all four of the officers involved in the episode. On May 29, the Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, announced third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges against Derek Chauvin, the officer seen most clearly in witness videos pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds, according to a Times analysis of timestamped video. Our video investigation shows that Mr. Chauvin did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nOn June 3, Hennepin County prosecutors added a more serious second-degree murder charge against Mr. Chauvin and also charged each of the three other former officers \xe2\x80\x94 Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao \xe2\x80\x94 with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, the Hennepin County attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office said that its criminal complaint misstated the amount of time Mr. Chauvin kept his knee on Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neck. The complaint originally said that Mr. Chauvin had done so for eight minutes and 46 seconds, a length of time that became a symbol and rallying cry for protesters. Responding to inquiries from journalists who noted a discrepancy with the durations listed in the complaint, the office said the actual time was seven minutes and 46 seconds. But The Times\xe2\x80\x99s own analysis of the video shows that this revised time is also incorrect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jamar Nelson, who works with the families of crime victims in Minneapolis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom line is, it was long enough to kill him, long enough to execute him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'"
"b'On the evening of May 25, 2020, white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kills George Floyd, a Black man, by kneeling on his neck for almost 10 minutes. The death, recorded by bystanders, touched off what is possibly the largest protest movement in U.S. history and a nationwide reckoning on race and policing.\r\n\r\nThe 46-year-old Floyd, a Houston native and father of five, had purchased cigarettes at a Minneapolis convenience store. After a clerk suspected that Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 bill in the transaction, the store manager called the police. When officers arrived, they pulled a gun on Floyd, who initially cooperated as he was arrested. However, Floyd resisted being placed in the police car, saying he was claustrophobic. Officers eventually pulled him from the car and Chauvin pinned him to the ground for nine minutes and 29 seconds. Floyd was unresponsive when an ambulance came and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.\r\n\r\nAfter video of the incident was posted on Facebook, protests began almost immediately in Minneapolis and quickly spread across the nation. Demonstrators chanting \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Lives Matter\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI Can\xe2\x80\x99t Breathe\xe2\x80\x9d took to the streets from coast to coast, and police departments around the country responded with riot-control tactics. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s murder came after protests over the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Atlanta in February and of Breonna Taylor in Louisville in March, and also came in the third month of nationwide lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nBy early June, protests were so widespread that over 200 American cities had imposed curfews and half of the United States had activated the National Guard. Marches continued and spread throughout June, despite the restrictions on gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic and militarized resistance from federal and local law enforcement.\r\n\r\nAll told, more than 2,000 cities and towns in all 50 states saw some form of demonstration in the weeks after Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s death, as well as major cities across the globe.\r\n\r\nThe protests set off local and national dialogue about the role and budgets of American police departments, as well as intense discussions in schools and corporations about how to end racism and create inclusivity, equality and equity.\r\n\r\nChauvin, who had at least 17 other misconduct complaints lodged against him prior to killing Floyd, was arrested on May 29, 2020 and charged with second-degree and third-degree murder, as well as second-degree manslaughter. On April 20, 2021, after a trial, which was broadcast live online and on TV due to the pandemic, a jury found Chauvin guilty of all charges. He was later sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison. \r\n'"
"b'At about 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report.\r\n\r\nMr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.\r\n\r\nDuring this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.\r\n\r\nHe lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.\r\n\r\nThat\'s when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd\'s last.\r\n\r\nTwitter hides Trump tweet for \'glorifying violence\'\r\nMr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.\r\n\r\nFor more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd\'s neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time.\r\n\r\nThe transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"".\r\n\r\nAt one point, Mr Floyd gasps: ""You\'re going to kill me, man.""\r\n\r\nDerek Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court in Minneapolis on Monday\r\nIMAGE SOURCE,REUTERS\r\nImage caption,\r\nDerek Chauvin is charged with second degree murder\r\nOfficer Chauvin replies: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.""\r\n\r\nMr Floyd says: ""Can\'t believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I\'m dead.""\r\n\r\nA female bystander told the police: ""His nose is bleeding, come on now.""\r\n\r\nAbout six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.\r\n\r\nOfficer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd\'s right wrist, but ""couldn\'t find one"". Yet the other officers did not move.\r\n\r\nAt 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd\'s neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.\r\n\r\nHe was pronounced dead about an hour later.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia caption,\r\nIn June Panorama spoke to local people to piece together the moments leading up to George Floyd\'s death\r\n\r\nOn the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.\r\n\r\nForgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.\r\n\r\n""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn\'t designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can\'t get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.""\r\n'"
"b""The killing of George Floyd, 46, of St. Louis Park \xe2\x80\x94 who repeatedly told a Minneapolis police officer he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t breathe as the officer knelt on his neck on May 25, 2020 \xe2\x80\x94 sparked days of unrest in Minneapolis and St. Paul and mass protests across the globe over the treatment of Black people by police. \r\n\r\nSince then, lawmakers both nationally and locally have debated police reform and whether law enforcement officers must change how they do their jobs. In schools, educators and students have tackled discussions on race and equity, sometimes with controversy. And across Minnesota, community members have marched and come together in a call for change. \r\n\r\nIn April 2021, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin \xe2\x80\x94 who pressed his knee on Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neck for more than nine minutes \xe2\x80\x94 was convicted of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison.\r\n\r\nThe three other ex-cops who were involved with the arrest have been charged with two counts each of aiding and abetting in the death. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao go on trial in June 2022.\r\n\r\nA federal grand jury has also indicted all four on criminal civil rights charges.\r\n"""
"b"" \r\nMore than one million people have fled Sudan to neighboring countries since April, according to the United Nations, as fighting between two warring factions plunges the country into civil war.\r\n\r\nThe conflict in Sudan has displaced more than 3.4 million people inside the country, a report released on Tuesday by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Those who escaped Sudan have arrived in other countries in the region including Egypt, Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nHeavy fighting broke out between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in mid-April, triggering a mass exodus of refugees from the East African country, where allied militias have been accused of killing civilians, ransacking houses and ethnic cleansing, leading to accusations of crimes against humanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime is running out for farmers to plant the crops that will feed them and their neighbors.

"b'Joe Biden has drawn a direct, provocative link between Russia\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s attack on Israel as he urged Americans not to walk away from their role as \xe2\x80\x9ca beacon to the world\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nIn only the second Oval Office address of his presidency, Biden said he would ask Congress to provide aid for both Israel and Ukraine and denounced the scourge of antisemitism and Islamophobia at home.\r\n\r\nThe president\xe2\x80\x99s 15-minute address sought to weave the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts together to convince war-weary voters and hardline Republicans of America\xe2\x80\x99s obligations. It is a conflation that will make some uneasy, especially as Israel, with vastly superior military power, prepares for a ground invasion of Gaza.\r\n\r\nJoe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s warning to Israel is a nod to US failures in the \xe2\x80\x98war on terror\xe2\x80\x99\r\nRead more\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biden, sitting at the Resolute desk with flags, family photos, gold curtains and a darkened window behind him.\r\n\r\nThe duelling crises are providing a daunting diplomatic test for the former chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee who, at 80, is older than the state of Israel itself. That did not prevent him making a whirlwind trip to the country on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nIn Tel Aviv, Biden backed Israel as it gears up for a ground invasion of Gaza after the 7 October attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people. But he also brokered a deal to get some aid through Egypt into the Gaza Strip and, he said, urged Israel to \xe2\x80\x9coperate by the laws of war\xe2\x80\x9d. More than 3,000 Palestinians have already died in the enclave from the past 12 days of aerial bombardment.\r\n\r\nJoe Biden is welcomed by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Wednesday.\r\nJoe Biden is welcomed by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. Photograph: Avi Ohayon/Israel Gpo/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock\r\nThe president said Hamas had unleashed \xe2\x80\x9cpure unadulterated evil in the world\xe2\x80\x9d and he met Israelis in \xe2\x80\x9cdeep, deep pain\xe2\x80\x9d. He also spoke with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and reiterated the US commitment to a two-state solution.\r\n\r\nBiden\xe2\x80\x99s planned summit in Jordan was cancelled after a Gaza hospital explosion that triggered angry protests across the Middle East. He described himself as \xe2\x80\x9cheartbroken\xe2\x80\x9d by the loss of life but reiterated the US position that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot done by the Israelis\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nThe president then turned to Ukraine, a cause that has seen ebbing support from the US public and Republicans in Congress. Having spoken to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy hours earlier, Biden said: \xe2\x80\x9cI know these conflicts can seem far away. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural to ask, why does this matter to America? Let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America\xe2\x80\x99s national security.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory has taught us that when terrorists don\xe2\x80\x99t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don\xe2\x80\x99t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going and the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough commentators are likely to question whether the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts are comparable, for Biden it was a way of entreating Congress not to walk away from either.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, we turn our backs on Israel, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president added that on Friday he would send an urgent budget request to Congress to fund support for partners including Israel and Ukraine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a smart investment that is going to pay dividends for American security for generations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe Biden delivers a prime-time address to the nation about the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\r\nJoe Biden delivers a prime-time address to the nation about the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/UPI/Shutterstock\r\nThe sweeping emergency funding request is reportedly likely to total around $100bn, including $60bn for Ukraine and $10bn for Israel. But it comes at a moment when the House of Representatives is paralysed with Republicans, who hold a narrow majority, unable to elect a new Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden said that helping the two US allies was \xe2\x80\x9ca smart investment that\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay dividends for American security for generations\xe2\x80\x9d, as he sought to rally support for the new aid packages.\r\n\r\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that the president\xe2\x80\x99s description of support as an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment\xe2\x80\x9d showed that Washington benefits from proxy wars rather than fights for ideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWars have traditionally been \xe2\x80\x98smart investments\xe2\x80\x99 for the United States as they did not take place on the American soil and they do not care about costs borne by others,\xe2\x80\x9d Zakharova said.\r\n\r\nThe conflict in Israel has heightened tensions further in the US with protests and counter-protests across the nation. Biden has faced criticism from activists and some in his own Democratic party for tying America\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes to those of Israel while underplaying humanitarian concerns for the more than two million people in Gaza.\r\n\r\nHe devoted part of his Oval Office address to denouncing both antisemitism and Islamophobia at home. \xe2\x80\x9cTo all of you hurting \xe2\x80\xa6 I want you to know, I see you. You belong. And I want to say this to you: You\xe2\x80\x99re all America.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know many of you in the Muslim American community, the Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, and so many others are outraged and hurting, saying to yourself, here we go again, with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBiden cited the killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a six-year-old boy from a Palestinian American family, outside Chicago. After the address, Biden and first lady Jill Biden spoke with Wadea\xe2\x80\x99s father and uncle to express their condolences, the White House said.\r\n\r\nThe US has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran or Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s Hezbollah, both allies of Hamas, from getting involved in the conflict. Biden concluded his remarks with a rallying call aimed at both a dysfunctional Congress and a public where the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica first\xe2\x80\x9d isolationism espoused by Donald Trump still has significant traction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is a beacon to the world still,\xe2\x80\x9d the president said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut time is of the essence. I know we have our divisions at home. We have to get past them. We can\xe2\x80\x99t let petty partisan angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants Putin win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrump, the most likely challenger to Biden in next year\xe2\x80\x99s election, poured scorn on his efforts. His campaign said in a statement: \xe2\x80\x9cAs America stumbles ever closer to World War III, Joe Biden is Neville Chamberlain trying to pose as Winston Churchill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an arsonist promising to rescue us from the world he set on fire. Europe and the Middle East are ablaze because of Crooked Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s failed presidency. His credibility is shot, and our enemies and allies alike regard him as a pathetic joke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemocrats welcomed the address, however. Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile President Biden has unequivocally stood with Israel and Ukraine, House Republicans have shown their complete incompetence and thrown the House of Representatives into chaos \xe2\x80\x93 potentially putting critical aid to support our allies and protect our national security at risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'"
"b'WASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 With tensions spiking in the Middle East, U.S. forces in the region are facing increasing threats as a Navy warship shot down missiles appearing to head toward Israel Thursday and American bases in Iraq and Syria were repeatedly targeted by drone attacks.\r\n\r\nLater, a U.S. official said there had been a rocket attack early Friday morning on U.S. and coalition forces at a diplomatic support center near the Baghdad International Airport. Initial assessments indicated two rockets were fired, the official said, noting that one was intercepted by a counter-rocket system and the other struck an empty storage facility.\r\n\r\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public, said no casualties were reported.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier, the USS Carney, a Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea, intercepted three land attack cruise missiles and several drones that were launched by Houthi forces in Yemen. The action by the Carney potentially represented the first shots by the U.S. military in the defense of Israel in this conflict.\r\n\r\nOTHER NEWS\r\nThis is a locator map for Iraq with its capital, Baghdad.

Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, told reporters the missiles were \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially\xe2\x80\x9d headed toward Israel but said the U.S. hasn\xe2\x80\x99t finished its assessment of what they were targeting.\r\n\r\nA U.S. official said they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the missiles \xe2\x80\x94 which were shot down over the water \xe2\x80\x94 were aimed at the U.S. warship. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations that had not yet been announced.\r\n\r\nBut an array of other drone attacks over the past three days did target U.S. bases, including one in southern Syria on Thursday that caused minor injuries.\r\n\r\nThe rash of violence comes in the wake of a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital, triggering protests in a number of Muslim nations. The Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in retaliation for the devastating Hamas rampage in southern Israel almost two weeks ago, but Israel has denied responsibility for the al-Ahli hospital blast and the U.S. has said its intelligence assessment found that Tel Aviv was not to blame.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent days, however, a number of militant groups across the region \xe2\x80\x94 from Hezbollah to the Houthis \xe2\x80\x94 have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel. Since Tuesday, militants have launched at least four drone attacks on U.S. military installations in Iraq and Syria where U.S. troops train local defense forces and support the mission to counter the Islamic State group.\r\n\r\nThe attacks fuel escalating worries in the U.S. and the West that the war in Israel could expand into a larger regional conflict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we are trying to prevent,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryder said.\r\n\r\nThe most recent drone attack was Thursday at al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq posted a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, saying they had fired a salvo of rockets at the base and \xe2\x80\x9cthey hit their targets directly and precisely.\xe2\x80\x9d A U.S. official confirmed the latest attack but said it was too early to assess any impact.\r\n\r\nAlso Thursday, the al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria was struck by drones. U.S. troops have maintained a presence at the base for a number of years to train Syrian allies and monitor Islamic State militant activity.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon said one drone was shot down, but another hit the base and caused minor injuries.\r\n\r\nThe garrison is located on a vital road that often used by Iranian-backed militants to ferry weapons to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon \xe2\x80\x94 and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s doorstep.\r\n\r\nSyrian opposition activists also said there was a separate drone attack on an oil facility in eastern Syria that houses American troops. Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who heads the Deir Ezzor 24 media outlet, said three drones with explosives struck the Conoco gas field in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, also confirmed explosions at the site.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, militants launched three drones against two Iraq bases that the U.S. uses to train forces and conduct operations against the Islamic State. During the spate of launches, one warning turned out to be a false alarm at al-Asad, but it sent personnel rushing into bunkers. During that incident, a contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died, Ryder said.\r\n\r\nHe said the Pentagon does not yet have confirmation on who launched the drone attacks but said the U.S. \xe2\x80\x9dwill take all necessary actions to defend U.S. and coalition forces against any threat.\xe2\x80\x9d He said any military response would come \xe2\x80\x9cat a time and a manner of our choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIranian-backed militias in Iraq have sometimes been used as foot soldiers in regional conflicts, including in Syria and Yemen, and have in recent days threatened to attack U.S. facilities in Iraq and elsewere because of American support for Israel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur missiles, drones, and special forces are ready to direct qualitative strikes at the American enemy in its bases and disrupt its interests if it intervenes in this battle,\xe2\x80\x9d Ahmad \xe2\x80\x9cAbu Hussein\xe2\x80\x9d al-Hamidawi, head of the Kataib Hezbollah militia, said in a statement last Wednesday. He also threatened to launch missiles at Israeli targets.\r\n\r\nFollowing the blast at the hospital in Gaza, the group issued another statement in which it blamed the U.S. and its support for Israel for the catastrophe and called for an end to the U.S. presence in Iraq.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese evil people must leave the country. Otherwise, they will taste the fire of hell in this world before the afterlife,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said.\r\n\r\nOn the intercepts by the Carney, Ryder said the strikes were done because the Houthi missiles \xe2\x80\x9cposed a potential threat\xe2\x80\x9d based on their flight profile. He added that the U.S. is prepared to do whatever is needed \xe2\x80\x9cto protect our partners and our interests in this important region.\xe2\x80\x9d He said the U.S. is still assessing what the target was, but said no U.S. forces or civilians on the ground were injured.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIranian-backed Houthi rebels have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel. Last week, in Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s Sanaa, which is held by the Houthi rebels still at war with a Saudi-led coalition, demonstrators crowded the streets waving Yemeni and Palestinian flags. The rebels\xe2\x80\x99 slogan long has been, \xe2\x80\x9cGod is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse of the Jews; victory to Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLast week, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, the rebel group\xe2\x80\x99s leader, warned the United States against intervening in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, threatening that his forces would retaliate by firing drones and missiles.\r\n\r\nWhen approached Thursday, two Houthi officials declined to comment on the incident. One said he was unaware of the incident, while the second said he did not have the authority to speak about it.\r\n'"
