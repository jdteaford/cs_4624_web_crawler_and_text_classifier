The two immediately connected over similar interests in music. They’ve lived together in five different houses and played music in Portland and Minneapolis over the years.</p><p>Golden was a talented artist, songwriter and photographer, according to May. He has played in three bands and was most recently the lead singer and guitarist of Scrounger, a three-member punk rock band Golden recently formed with May in Minneapolis.</p><figure class="figure figure-right figure-half"><picture class="" data-testid="picture"><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://img.apmcdn.org/8f1e1724ba461d102166238f1090c6eeff2bbe6a/uncropped/7b2560-20230814-two-people-pose-for-a-photo-on-a-polaroid-webp400.webp 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8f1e1724ba461d102166238f1090c6eeff2bbe6a/uncropped/a184dc-20230814-two-people-pose-for-a-photo-on-a-polaroid-webp600.webp 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8f1e1724ba461d102166238f1090c6eeff2bbe6a/uncropped/353bf2-20230814-two-people-pose-for-a-photo-on-a-polaroid-webp960.webp 960w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="webp"/><source type="image/jpeg" srcSet="https://img.apmcdn.org/8f1e1724ba461d102166238f1090c6eeff2bbe6a/uncropped/7134ad-20230814-two-people-pose-for-a-photo-on-a-polaroid-400.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8f1e1724ba461d102166238f1090c6eeff2bbe6a/uncropped/06c3a3-20230814-two-people-pose-for-a-photo-on-a-polaroid-600.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8f1e1724ba461d102166238f1090c6eeff2bbe6a/uncropped/f8793b-20230814-two-people-pose-for-a-photo-on-a-polaroid-960.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"/><img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/8f1e1724ba461d102166238f1090c6eeff2bbe6a/uncropped/06c3a3-20230814-two-people-pose-for-a-photo-on-a-polaroid-600.jpg" alt="Two people pose for a photo on a polaroid "/></picture><figcaption class="figure_caption"><div class="figure_text">August Golden and his partner, Caitlin Angelica.</div><div class="figure_credit">Courtesy of Caitlin Angelica</div></figcaption></figure><p>On Monday, Hennepin County’s medical examiner identified the victim as Nicholas Golden, a name May said Golden hasn’t used in a decade. According to May, August was a chosen name inspired by August Spies, which resonated more with Golden.</p><p>Spies was a radical labor activist who was killed in the aftermath of the 1886 Haymarket Affair in Chicago, a worldwide symbol of the struggle for worker’s rights. He also said Golden wasn’t very concerned with gender norms, as is common in the punk scene.</p><p>“August, as with everyone in this community, felt it was very important to create safe spaces for trans and gender-variant people, young and old,” said May.</p><p>Outside of his love for music, he was a brother, son, friend and partner. On any given day in Golden’s life, May said you’d find him trying to fix an old record player he found, writing a new song or sitting on a porch with a beer in hand trading stories into the night.</p><p>“He was in a really good relationship and had this band he was really excited about — the first one in eight years that he had been in or started and just felt really connected to the people here and the music, the music community and underground music community,” said May. “I feel like I&#x27;ve seen him smile more in the past year than I have in 14 years.”</p><figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"><picture class="" data-testid="picture"><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/de5035-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-webp400.webp 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/ad89c4-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-webp600.webp 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/837ac1-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-webp1000.webp 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/cdf6fc-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-webp1400.webp 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/340424-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-webp2000.webp 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="webp"/><source type="image/jpeg" srcSet="https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/f93d70-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-400.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/2957d0-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-600.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/fa148b-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-1000.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/688de4-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-1400.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/188be7-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-2000.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"/><img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/c3916ab78133ce600a6b893f127c1398b8a8dc26/uncropped/2957d0-20230814-people-pose-next-to-a-van-600.jpg" alt="People pose next to a van"/></picture><figcaption class="figure_caption"><div class="figure_text">August Golden, Bryan May and Morgan Purcell and after their tour van got totaled on the way to a show.</div><div class="figure_credit">Courtesy of Bryan May</div></figcaption></figure><p>May said Golden helped him see Minneapolis through new eyes. </p><p>“I can get a little cynical, and he showed up and was just like, ‘This place is incredible.
